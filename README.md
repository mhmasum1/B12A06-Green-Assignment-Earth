Answer all the questions:
1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
  var is function-scoped, can be re-declared, and is hoisted.
  let is block-scoped, reassignable, but not re-declarable in the same scope.
  const is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned or re-declared.
2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
   map() loops through an array and returns a new array with transformed data.
   forEach() loops through an array but does not return anything.
   filter() returns a new array with elements that match a condition.
3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
   A shorter way to write functions using =>.They don’t have their own this, making them useful in callbacks.
4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
   Destructuring assignment in ES6 lets you extract values from arrays or objects into separate variables in a single, concise statement.
5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
   Use backticks `` and ${}, Support multi-line strings without \n.Easier and cleaner than string concatenation using +.
